inform an employer that, through your studies, you have acquired discipline knowledge and a range of other skills
and capabilities which employers would value in a professional setting. Each unit in your course addresses the
Graduate Capabilities through a clearly identified set of learning outcomes. They form a vital part in the process
referred to as assurance of learning. The learning outcomes notify you of what you are expected to know,
understand or be able to do in order to be successful in this unit. Each assessment for this unit is carefully
designed to test your knowledge of one or more of the unit learning outcomes. On successfully completing all of
the assessments you will have achieved all of these learning outcomes.
